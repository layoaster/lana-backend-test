# Lana Backend Code Test
Lana's [code challenge][code-test] for the backend position.

## Description / Architecture
I've decided to go with *Python* to solve this challenge and give
[Fast API][fast-api] a try.

The server implements a RESTful API without data persistence. Instead, in-memory
Python objects would be used as a database.

To avoid the hassle of writing a web app (HTML/CSS/Javascript is not my thing)
the client would a CLI-based app.

Simplicity over complexity without hurting scalability is the main principle that
I've followed.
